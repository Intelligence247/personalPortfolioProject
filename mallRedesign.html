            <h1>Brand Research</h1>
            <p>Vision, Values, Touchpoints</p>
            <p>We started the project by researching the company, brand values and vision, and gathering any type of
                data
                the client had from previous surveys. Below are a few highlights we discovered about our client:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Experience</strong> Visitors get to shop at the worlds largest outdoor mall in the nation,
                    which
                    takes advantage of Oahu's beautiful weather.</li>
                <li><strong>Social Media </strong>Audiences will most likely get information through social media first
                    because it is updated frequently and is the easiest to update.</li>
                <li><strong>Going Mobile </strong>82% (2012 survey) of visitors to the mall do general shopping and
                    browsing
                    without a specific store in mind. By building a mobile-friendly website, we can assist a shopper's
                    on-site discovery of different merchants and vendors or suggest mall specials they may have not
                    previously known about.</li>
                <li><strong>Reviews </strong>Since a vast majority of shoppers (~83% - 2012 survey) have an overall
                    "good"
                    or "excellent" shopping or dining experience, they are likely to write a positive review of the mall
                    on
                    Trip Advisor, Yelp, or other large websites.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>After understanding more about their business, we did a heuristic review of their current website and a
                competitive analysis with other local and national brands.</p>

                    <p>Current Site</p>
                    <p>
                        The website caters to a large audience, which include local, national, and international
                        visitors.
                        They
                        offer a variety of promotions and events which are either store or mall specific. Below are some
                        points
                        we
                        touched upon when comparing their web presence with other competitors:</p>

                    <h1>Pros</h1>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The brand is represented well in the design with floral patterns, attractive photography,
                            and
                            use of curves.</li>
                        <li>Each page has a different color scheme, which keeps the site lively and interesting.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h1>Cons</h1>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Home page slideshow images transition automatically with no controls.</li>
                        <li>Mall hours are low on the page.</li>
                        <li>Side navigation is hidden and dominated by other sections.</li>
                        <li>Body content and headings have poor hierarchy. Headings, sub-headings, and body text can be
                            treated differently so they don't blend in with each other.</li>
                        <li>Although active on social media, the site does not represent this.</li>

                    directory
                    map, mall hours, dynamic imagery, and easy to find updates.</p>

            <h1>Customer Surveys</h1>
            <p>Insights</p>
            <p>Data from 800 shoppers were collected and we confirmed earlier assumptions about site visitors. Below are
                some highlights:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Unclear messaging </strong>70% of users found the website content written in a clear and
                    concise manner, but the other 30% answered that it wasn't. We needed to focus our efforts on content
                    strategy to deliverer a clearer message to customers.</li>
                <li><strong>Web Savvy</strong> 59% of users accessed the website via desktop/laptop and 25% on a smart
                    phone. This validated that we needed to focus on a responsive site for a seamless experience.</li>
                <li><strong>Social Media </strong> 69% people of surveyed were not aware of any social media presence by
                    the mall and of those who knew, only 9% interacted on a social media network. We all discovered this
                    to be a largely missed opportunity to interact with users and that more of an effort should be made
                    in all of their channels.</li>
                <li><strong>Parking </strong>71% of users felt parking was very important to an enjoyable shopping
                    experience. This allowed us to focus on creating a map specifically for drivers marked with
                    entrances, exits, parking areas, and valet parking options.</li>
            </ul>

                    <h1>Our Approach</h1>
                    <p>The website only offered a static map of shopping center. It was very tedious to update since
                        there
                        are multiple floors, hundreds of shops, and over a dozen restaurants. At the time, the mall was
                        under construction and tenants were moving on a monthly basis which proved frustrating to
                        visitors
                        since maps weren't updated in a timely fashion.</p>
                    <p>
                        We wanted to to integrate Google Maps for an interactive experience for any user using any type
                        of
                        device. Additionally, it would be easier for staff to update the map.</p>
                    <p>New and returning customers requested a detailed store page which highlights specials, specific
                        store
                        hours, amenities, featured brands, and other details. By providing more information, we all felt
                        it
                        would increase store traffic, especially if a store didn't have a personal website.</p>

    <section class="stakeholder survey research">

        <div class="insight researchtexts">
            <h1>Stakeholder Interviews</h1>
            <p>Experience and Motivations</p>
            <p>The most common and agreed upon pain point would be how the maps for the mall are displayed and this is
                the first thing that should be improved upon when redoing the website.</p>
            <p>Also, updates for the website go through a third party vendor, but they would like to change that work
                flow so they have control over editing in a timelier fashion.</p>
            <p>Other concerns they addressed included:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Improve search functionality by adding product tags, brand name tags, autocorrect for misspellings,
                    and include mall events.</li>
                <li>Detailed event listings to engage customers. </li>
                <li> Easier to update in-house.</li>
                <li>Store owners can update their information without contacting marketing staff.</li>
                <li>Consistent content and layout for all languages.</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Our Approach</h2>
            <p>We all felt that WordPress would be the best solution to maintain store data, allow the marketing team to
                easily update information and post events, and easy management of localization. As designs were being
                updated and approved, we began to develop the site to ensure all these asks could be met.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="quote interviewQ">
            <h1>Quotes</h1>
            <p>"It's a matter of how we describe where things are located in text and also visually if that's even
                possible. Access to the property, that's a big challenge. We've got like what, eighteen entrances to the
                property around you know? How do you tell people to come in?"</p>
            <p>"If I was a traveler, I would want to know where all the locals shop. Where all the deals are."</p>

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>Working very closely with the client during every step of the process helped them learn the proper
                steps it takes to build a large-scale site out properly. The client was happy with our process,
                survey findings, designs, and our ability to suggest solutions to their problems. Due to unforeseen
                circumstances which were out of everyone's hands, the project was canceled during the start of
                development and never launched.</p>
