            <h1>Discovery</h1>
            <p>Measure Twice, Cut Once</p>
            <p>Before any design work started, we met with the client and asked some of the following questions which
                could affect designs or implementation:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Demographics </strong>Will this be for public schools only? Should we assume a large number
                    of parents are non-native English speaking because of the diverse cultures found in Hawaii?</li>
                <li><strong>Empathy</strong> Teachers, coordinators, and parents have busy lives. How can we provide a
                    streamlined solution with very little instruction or an overly complicated on-boarding process?</li>
                <li><strong>Complications</strong> Will parents need to track sales for more than one child attending
                    different schools?</li>
                <li><strong>Stand Out</strong> Who are your competitors? What are they doing right? What are they doing
                    wrong?</li>
                <li><strong>Scope Creep</strong> What is the most practical CMS to use and how will that be implemented?
                    We should not over engineer this project.</li>
                <li><strong>Community</strong> Will you allow people the ability purchase from a fundraiser if the have
                    no connection to a school?</li>
            </ul>
            <p>After gathering feedback, we went had a better understanding of the space and how to approach providing a
                solution. Several discovery documents were created, which included the interviews, userflows, sitemaps,
                and wireframes.</p>

                <p>The company wanted to keep the brand and users in mind, so a treatment of bright, warm colors were

            <p> A responsive e-commerce site was built on Shopify to shift selling efforts online to eliminate
                door-to-door solicitation. An interface was also created for parents to track their child's sale
                progress and also gave them the ability to share a fundraiser with family and friends.

                <p>The goal of the dashboard was to make inputting cookie sales as easy as possible for fundraiser
                    coordinators. They can input, track, and edit sales for each seller in a streamline and efficient
                    manner.</p>

            <h1>Production</h1>
            <p>To keep design costs to a minimum, only a few mock-ups were created for approval. Once the overall look
                and feel were established, we applied styles to the approved wireframes, reducing the overall project
                time. A custom CMS (content management system) was also built so administrators could manage the
                dashboard and site content.</p>

            <h1>Results</h1>
            <p>There was a 98% adoption rate since launching in the summer of 2014. Positive feedback and a steady flow
                of online sales proved that the newly built dashboard was effective for School Kine Cookies. Inventory
                management from live sales data also helped administrators get a better understanding of how
                coordinators may need assistance from start to finish of their fundraisers.</p>
